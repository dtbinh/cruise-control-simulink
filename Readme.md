## Cruise control modeling in Simulink and matlab
* Simulated cruise control system in vehicles using a matlab model. Several parameters can be varied in config/simulink files (mass of vehicle, slope road conditions)
* Use `plot_results.m` to plot the parameters.
* Import the mdl file in simulink along with all related .m files (to be in same directory) to run.
* PID and PI control modes are available(`cruise_ctrl_only_pi...`)
